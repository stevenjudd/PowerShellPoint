Using PowerShell To Prove That Six Is Greater Than Seven,"""six"" -gt ""seven""",yes
But what about...,"""six"" -gt 7",yes
"Ah, but the left to right type casting","6 -gt ""seven""",yes
Of course this will work,6 -gt 7,yes
"Why is ""six"" -gt ""seven""","PowerShell is using a numeric value for the string content (I'm assuming the ASCII code?). Thus, alphabetically, ""si"" comes after ""se"" therefore it is greater.",
What we have learned,You can use the comparison operators on string content. Just make sure you are comparing like types.,
Best practice,Cast your variables to ensure you get the results you expect,
"""six"" -afraid ""seven""",Now all we have to do is figure out why six is afraid of seven...,
